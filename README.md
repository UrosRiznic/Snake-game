# Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Project: Snake Game with Deep Q Learning - Uroš Riznić


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an AI Bot able to learn how to play the popular game Snake from scratch. In order to do it, I implemented a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. This approach consists in giving the system parameters related to its state, and a positive or negative reward based on its actions. No rules about the game are given, and initially the Bot has no information on what it needs to do. The goal for the system is to figure it out and elaborate a strategy to maximize the score - or the reward. \
We are going to see how a Deep Q-Learning algorithm learns how to play Snake, scoring up to 50 points and showing a solid strategy after only 5 minutes of training. \
Additionally, it is possible to run the Bayesian Optimization method to find the optimal parameters of the Deep neural network, as well as some parameters of the Deep RL approach.

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 with the pygame library installed, Keras and other Libs. 
In your console, type : 
```bash
pip install (library that is needed)
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UrosRiznic/Snake-game
```

## Run
To run and show the game, executes in the snake-ga folder:

```python
python snakeClass.py
```
Arguments description:

- --display - Type bool, default True, display or not game view
- --speed - Type integer, default 50, game speed

The default configuration loads the file *weights/weights.h5* and runs a test.

To train the agent, set in the file snakeClass.py:
- `params['train'] = True`
The parameters of the Deep neural network can be changed in *snakeClass.py* by modifying the dictionary `params` in the function `define_parameters()`

If you run snakeClass.py from the command line, you can set the arguments `--display=False` and `--speed=0`. This way, the game display is not shown and the training phase is faster.


## For Mac users
It seems there is a OSX specific problem, since many users cannot see the game running.
To fix this problem, in update_screen(), add this line.

```                              
def update_screen():
    pygame.display.update() <br>
    pygame.event.get() # <--- Add this line ###
```
